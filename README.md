This repo contains the kotlin implementation of TensorflowLite Example Apps [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples), which are mostly implemented in java rightnow.
So if you like to see the kotlin, you can go through the repo!

# Example apps

## Depth Estimation

An Android app which uses the MiDaS model to perform monocular depth estimation on RGB images directly. The app displays a depth map over the live camera feed and works for both the front and the rear cameras.

## Digit Classifier
*End-to-end sample of a digit classifier model built with TensorFlow 2.0 (Keras API), and trained on MNIST dataset.*

Added from: [this repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples)

## Image Segmentation
The used model, [DeepLab](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/semantic-image-segmentation-with.html) is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g. person, dog, cat) to every pixel in the input image.

## Optical Character Recognition
OCR is the process of recognizing characters from images using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This reference app demos how to use TensorFlow Lite to do OCR. It uses a text detection model and a text recognition model as a pipeline to recognize texts.

## Pose Estimation
This is an app that continuously detects the body parts in the frames seen by your device's camera. These instructions walk you through building and running the demo on an Android device. Camera captures are discarded immediately after use, nothing is stored or saved.

## PoseNet
This is an app that continuously detects the body parts in the frames seen by your device's camera. These instructions walk you through building and running the demo on an Android device. Camera captures are discarded immediately after use, nothing is stored or saved.

## Sound Classification
This Android application demonstrates how to classify sound on-device. It uses:

- TFLite Task Library
- YAMNet, an audio event classification model.

Added from: [this repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples)

## Style Transfer
Artistic style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images: a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter) and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but ‚Äúpainted‚Äù in the style of the style reference image.
